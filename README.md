# LeaguerBoard

Wanting to create a responsive website utilizing HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery, I'm creating a website for my fantasy basebalal league that will showcase winners & stats from past seasons.

The site is in the very early stages, so very minimal CSS styling, JS or JQ added so far.
